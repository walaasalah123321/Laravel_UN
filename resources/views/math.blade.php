                Appl. Math. Inf. Sci. accepts papers through peer review by professional colleagues in the relevant fields. Unless clearly below the standard required by the journal, submitted articles will be sent to referees. They will generally be reviewed by at least two experts with the aim of reaching a decision as soon as possible. Where possible, the final decision is made on the basis that the referees are in accordance with one another. When there is a 
                strong disagreement between referees, advice is sought from a member of the journals Editorial Board.
